# Testing Fusesoc Versioning


## Prerequesites

Before using this repository, make sure that FuseSoC is installed on your system. 


## How to use

This repository contains several bash scripts that act as wrappers for FuseSoC commands. These scripts facilitate testing different versions of the Open-Logic library and running associated tests. Here's a quick overview of the available scripts:

- `init_*.sh`: Initializes the environment with the specified configuration.
- `run_*.sh`: Executes FuseSoC with a specified target.
- `clean.sh`: Cleans up the environment by removing generated files and caches.


## Examples

### Example 1

Check out what happens if development version and release version with identical version is initialized.


#### Command

```bash
./init_development_olo_3.2.0.sh
./init_release_olo_3.2.0.sh
./init_test_target_core.sh
fusesoc core list
```

#### Output

```bash
$ fusesoc core list

```

You can see that depending upon which version was last added to library is active.

### Example 2

It seems that versions with the -dev suffix do not work as expected. Specifically, the following commands lead to FuseSoC entering an infinite loop:

```bash
./init_development_olo_3.2.0-dev.sh
./init_test_target_core.sh
./run_base_test_target.sh
```
